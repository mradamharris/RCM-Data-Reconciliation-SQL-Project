# RCM-Data-Reconciliation-SQL-Project

<h1>JWipe - Disk Sanitization</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a single example of my experience in RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) healthcare analytics. The dataset and metrics shown here are a subset of dummy data to protect the rights and privacy of the company this was done for and those it serves. Although the data is fictional, this project was not. It helped an organization identify bottlenecks and millions of dollars in potential miscalculations. Allow me to walk you through an overview of the journey...
